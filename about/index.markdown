This blog is about my experiments in visual coding with [processing](http://processing.org).

The visuals are rendered in the browser thanks to [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/).

The page is generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [solar theme](https://github.com/redwallhp/solar-theme-jekyll).
