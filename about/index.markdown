This blog shows my experiments in creative coding with [processing](http://processing.org).

I am still learning! :)

The visuals are rendered in the browser thanks to [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/).

The page is generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [solar theme](https://github.com/redwallhp/solar-theme-jekyll).

Please feel free to give me feedback on [tyldurd@twitter](https://twitter.com/tyldurd)
