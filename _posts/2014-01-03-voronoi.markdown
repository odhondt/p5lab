Using a Voronoi tesselation to make an animated abstract painting from a photo.
The algorithm is simple and is implemented in a few lines. First a pixel is randomly picked in the original photo and the background is set to the pixel color. The (spatial) distance of each point to this pixel is stored in a matrix. Then, another pixel is picked and all the points that are closer to this new pixel are updated with the new color. And so on... Simple!
